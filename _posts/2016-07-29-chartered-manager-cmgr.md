![Matthew Jelavic, C.Mgr.](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d5be92d8-7455-4eff-8070-c69857b3c674.png)

_**A Charter of Distinction: Ethics and Sustainability in Management**_

Chartered Manager is the Canadian Institute of Management's senior qualification and chartered professional designation. It is abbreviated as C.Mgr. and used as a post-nominal to accredited members in good standing. It provides validation to outstanding adherence to the theory and practice of ethical management and the ongoing development of new methods in the management arts and sciences that focus on sustainability and leadership. It goes beyond academic qualification and provides clients with a benchmark of professionalism and ethical behaviour in business.

Chartered Manager is Canada's only senior multidisciplinary management designation. Its charter goes beyond accounting, financial management, organizational behaviour, strategy, marketing and human resources; combining several fields into one integrated qualification in ethical management. Holders of the C.Mgr. designation can be relied on to provide ethical, grounded and holistic managerial services and judgement and are the only professionals that can legally use the title of "Chartered Manager" in Canada.

Holders of the C.Mgr. designation will belong to a fellowship of peers that share the CIM's passion and enthusiasm for the development of leading-edge management knowledge and services to the public.

This fellowship of peers is a core resource of the CIM to maintain its position as Canada's senior multidisciplinary management association and the voice of the management profession.

Joining the CIM as a Chartered Manager will allow the applicant to become part of a tight-knit, yet open, community that will allow for the personal and professional development of management knowledge, application and theory.
